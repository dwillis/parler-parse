# parler-parse

Parler HTML goes in (stdin), structured JSON comes out (stdout)

Might be useful for feeding into elasticsearch or cross-referencing with the video/images dump. 

## Currently parses:

- OG Meta
- Posts + Echos 
	- Author (username + name)
	- Body
	- Media Attachments (Url, Title, Excerpt, Type)
- Comments
- Metrics (impressions, echoes, comment count, etc)
- All mentioned usernames in the post
